# Benchmarking and Evaluation of Deconvolution Algorithms
We present a comprehensive benchmark of the robustness and resilience of computational deconvolution methods for estimating cell type proportions in bulk tissue samples. This study focuses on comparing reference-based and reference-free approaches.  Below are all cell-level gene expression datasets used in this study.
